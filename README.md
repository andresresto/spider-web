# Spider Web
I never used to know where to start. I wanted to get plants for my apartment, but before I invested into plants, I wanted to pick up an xbox. Before the xbox, I needed to fix my car. Moreover, if I was going to fix my car, I needed to find a good mechanic. I just started work from home, so now before I drop all this money on a mechanic, I need to get a filing cabinet. However, the filing cabinet is not where to start. I should get a laptop stand. And before the laptop stand, I wanted to fix up my cable management, get peripherals before that, and then computer speakers before that. Now to get all that looking nice, I needed some desk accessories before I start. Did I miss an extension cable to get this all connected? Okay, I'll get that. But, I need to get a monitor stand before that I can use my monitor. Now thats a lot of money that's going to this. I need to organize my money. Damn, I need a Roth IRA.

So, I can't get plants because I need a Roth IRA? I found my life was organized in my head by dependencies. So, I am making Spider Web. An application that tracks milestones, todo's, and life in a web so you are sure you know what to do next.
